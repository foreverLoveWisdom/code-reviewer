- This Python Flask application leverages OpenAI's GPT model to conduct automated code reviews. It allows users to input code for review and receive actionable feedback based on predefined criteria. The application is designed to assist developers/tech leads/managers, in improving their code quality and adherence to best practices.
- This is just a guide to get you started. You can customize the `prompt` to suit your needs.

* To run the application:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install flask openai markdown2 python-dotenv`
2. Set up your OpenAI API key by creating a `.env` file in the root directory and adding your API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
3. Run the Flask app: `flask run`

  - This is a paid API. You will need to sign up for an API key at OPENAI https://platform.openai.com/overview to use this application.

* For more information on how the code review process works, refer to the `code_review.html` template in the `templates` directory.

* Suggestions for improvements:

  - Update the `prompt` to include more specific criteria for code review that
    suits your team's needs.
  - Allow users to upload files for review or automatically pull code from a
    repository, extract the diff, and submit it for review.
  - Add a feature to compare code before and after changes.
  - Add interactive features to the code review process.
  - Remember this is just a guide to get you started.
